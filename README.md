# CafeAutomation

In this cafe automation, the customer can browse the menu and look at the products. However, he / she will need to register and log in before he can place an order. Otherwise, he cannot see the menu prices and add products to his cart. After logging in, you can see the products added to the cart and place an order.
We put restrictions on name and surname using validators. If he/she does not consider this restriction the system will fail and will not complete the registration.
We put restrictions on emails using validators. If it is not written according to ..... @ .... com pattern, the system will give a warning.
 Password is the best thing to identify and distinguish the person. Therefore, this field should not be left empty, we have put restrictions for this.
We created a confirm field for password control. If the user doesn't enter the same, the system will give an error.
Alert messages appear on the page entered after the operation and goes away when the page is refreshed. Color is determined according to its category.For example, if category danger is in the red background, if category succes is in the green background.
